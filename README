Utility for processing a list of jerseys and sorting them into teams with unique numbers on each team.

Problem: 
    - Given a CSV of 300 jerseys (size, number) numbered from 1-20, with sizes s,m,l, assign 10 jerseys to each of 25 different teams.
    - Each team has a required number of jerseys per size. ( specified as a csv as follows: teamname, num_small, num_med, num_large ).

TODO::
    - address size imbalances
        - choose intelligently if size not available (eg. if no medium available choose large, not small)
    - pull team out of iteration when "full"

- simplify sorter? shouldn't need to instantiate.
